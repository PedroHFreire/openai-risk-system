Welcome to the risk system project! This project aims to develop a tool for identifying, measuring, and managing risks in financial portfolios.

## Getting started

To get started with the project, you will need to clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies.

```
git clone https://github.com/<your_username>/risk-system.git
cd risk-system
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To use the risk system, you will need to provide it with information about the financial portfolio that you want to analyze. This can include the stocks and other assets in the portfolio, as well as their weights and other relevant details.

Once you have provided this information, the risk system will use a variety of tools and techniques to identify, measure, and manage the risks in the portfolio. This can include using measures like beta and VaR to measure market risk, and implementing risk management strategies like diversification to manage that risk.
